# Output repository for case study "Optimization of advanced operating concepts"

`CADET-RDM` automatically tracks all simulations that are started by running `main.py` from the corresponding project repository.
Each run creates a dedicated branch in this output repository in which the results are stored.
Additionally, a `log.tsv` file in the 'main' branch records metadata for all runs, uniquely linking each output branch to its originating run in the project repository.
The project repository for this case study is available [here](https://github.com/schmoelder/diss_operating_modes).
The output repository can be found at:
